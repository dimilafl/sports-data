Sports Data Analysis

About
My project will take sports data, and use a react a frontend, paired with a django backend in order to display wide ranges of sports data. I would want to use python libraries such as Matplotlib, and Pandas (and others that may fit my data analysis needs) in order to analyze sports data in my app, in order to convey the data in various ways, to potentially make comparisons or predictions using Data Analysis
